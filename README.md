# Go-Todo Application â€“ Kubernetes with GitOps

This repository contains documentation for deploying the **Go-Todo** application using **Kubernetes** and **GitOps**.

  Contains backend, frontend, and base manifests.

- **Manifest Repo (GitOps):** [K8s_gitOps](https://github.com/SAYEM-16T/K8s_gitOps)  
  Used for ArgoCD to manage deployments and sync with the Kubernetes cluster.

This setup ensures a **production-ready, automated deployment** workflow using GitOps principles.
